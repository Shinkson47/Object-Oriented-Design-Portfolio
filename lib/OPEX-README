OPEX, The Open Phoenix Engine Library, is NOT a third party library.

Phoenix is a work in progress gaming library of my own creation, which is imported here for reusing
my own utility classes.

This portfolio will not contain any OPEX executables, or use the main engine for the any back end.
Sources for coursework will all be visible, and any uses of OPEX utilities will be minimal and explained in comments.

I declare all sources used (see git below) from this jar are of my own work,
including commits and classes signed under the alias' of 'Tyler', 'Gordie' and 'Shinkson47'.
